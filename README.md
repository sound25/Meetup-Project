# Meetup Project 

This project is deployed in Heroku and can be reached at https://meetup-project.herokuapp.com/
 
This project is developed using Django and sqlite.

It lists out the upcoming meetup details and allows users to register for a meetup using an email ID.

Admin will be able to add meetup information through admin site of this project.

In this project, I have implemented concepts such as Slug Field and Forieign Keys.
